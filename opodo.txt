Hi. I issued a change request for a flight this monday. The status is stuck in "Prioritizing your request" and I'd like to know what it hasn't been assigned yet?

[OPODO]
We noticed that you have recently requested a modification.
Our estimated processing time for your request is 48 hours.

[THOM]
48 hours have elapsed. nothing has progressed regarding my request for a change and the flight is on monday. 

Let me make this clear. This is the last time I will do business with Opodo. 

Instead I will purchase from the airlines directly, because I'd rather pay more than be thoroughly inconvenienced.

We noticed that you have recently requested a modification.

I have taken my complaints to Twitter

[LATER THAT DAY]

[THOM]
I put in a request for a flight change more than 2 days ago. In the mean time I was blocked from trying to inquire about it. 48 hours has elapsed. absolutely no progress has been made on the change.

[OPODO]
Of course, I will be happy to help you.

[THOM]
i am flying on monday, so I'd like this resolved so that I actually have peace of mind for flying to my job

[OPODO]
Who do I have the pleasure of chatting with?

[THOM]
I am logged in. I provided my booking number and my email. Isn't it obvious that I'm Thomas Bradford?
don't ask me for a CC#. I paid with PayPal. My postal code is XXXXX

[OPODO]
Ok Can you tell me the email address you used to make this reservation and your reservation reference number, please?

[THOM]
you mean the one I already entered to initiate this chat??
and the booking number I also used to enter this chat?

[OPODO]
Of course

[THOM]
Booking Number: XXXXXXXXXX
Email: xxxx@kode4food.it

[OPODO]
All right, please give me a moment, so I can look at this for you.
Ok, you do that. In the mean time, I'm going to say this sincerely. 

[THOM]
Diallo, I'm sure you're a nice person. But as someone who has directed customer care operations in the past, it is clear to me that Opodo doesn't care about you or any of your colleagues.

because there's a high probability that you're about to tell me "oh, I'm sorry, we can't change this flight." which is something that could have been told to me two days ago when I may have been offered a better fare elsewhere.

[OPODO]
I actually find that your request is being processed the deadline is 72 hours I invite you to be patient and reassure you that your departure date has been taken into account in this processing

[THOM]
I also see that the state it is in is "being processed" but that doesn't mean very much at the end of the day. It's probably a byte stored in a row in some MySQL database somewhere

And I'll reiterate what I said. Opodo doesn't care about you. When I was running an operation we made sure we weren't in the business of screwing over customers, which would significantly reduce the number of calls into customer care, particularly the ones where some irate customer is intent on yelling at somebody who has absolutely nothing to do with the backward policies of the company

[OPODO]
I fully understand your situation, but don't worry about where you requested in time

[THOM]
what are your stats on change resolutions? what percentage of change requests are actually successful?

[OPODO]
sorry MR / Thomas / BRADFORD I do not have access to these statistics,

[THOM]
also... where on the web site it is disclosed that there is a 72hr deadline for resolving change requests?

[OPODO]
you can check it well what is more important is that your request is successful
Is there anything else I can do to help you?

I wish you a good day / evening. Bye !


NOVEMBER 14 2021, 3:45 PM

[THOM]
Your 72 deadline has expired and there has been absolutely no change in the status of my change request

[OPODO]
Hi it‚Äôs Kris, your chat robot again üòäüëã 

It would be great to get some feedback about our chat today!
üëâ Rate experience ‚≠ê

[THOM]

why?

[OPODO]
Welcome to Opodo Customer Service. My name is S*******t B***t. And As I have understood, you require assistance with the changes, right?

[THOM]
Hi S*******t, let me save you some time. My booking reference number is XXXXXXXXXX. My email address is xxxx@kode4food.it. I used PayPal to make the purchase, so there is no credit card number. My postal code is XXXXX. I am contacting you because I made a change request over three days ago for a flight that is happening TOMORROW. Your support site kept me from inquiring until 48 hours had elapsed, after which I was instructed to contact you, and then I was told that you have a deadline of 72 hours to perform these changes. That deadline has elapsed. Where is the change? Also, the deadline is documented nowhere on your web site.

[OPODO]
I exponentially apologize for the inconvenience caused.

I'll be happy to assist you. May I know your name, please?

[THOM]
Thomas Bradford

[OPODO]
Thomas. To confirm, you were traveling from XXXXX to XXXXXX on Mon 15th Nov 2021 and returning on Wed 17th Nov 2021. Right?

[THOM]
that was my original booking, yes. with a change request that would get me to XXXXXX earlier on the 15th and have me returning on the 18th (Thur)

[OPODO]
Thank you for your confirmation. Thomas
I regret to inform you that the changes can be done via calls and chats only.

And I can escalate the case to apply the changes and it can take 72 hours, else you can call us to apply the changes and it can take done in no timel.

[THOM]

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
Is this a fucking joke?

[OPODO]
Thomas, I am informing the companies policy only here.

[THOM]
Why wasn't I told this when I originally made the change request on your web site? Why wasn't I told it yesterday? why wasn't I told this when I first went through the chat bot and phone automated systems 2 days before that?
Your company hates you and they hate their customers.

[OPODO]
I extremely apologize for the inconvenience caused, as a human I can understand.

[THOM]
72 hours to make a change for a flight that happens tomorrow. You do realize that this is the height of idiocy, correct?

[OPODO]
Unfortunately, I can only assist you with the options I have.

[THOM]
I'm going to tell you what I told your colleague yesterday. as someone who ran a customer care center, I can promise you that opodo hates you. Otherwise they wouldn't put you in a position where their corrupt policies would have customers yelling at and insulting you constantly

[OPODO]
I can understand that and I can only apologize for the inconvenience caused,
https://customercare.Opodo.com/en/support/tickets/new

Please use the companies complaint and claim form link.

[THOM]
no no, I will take my complaints to the public internet. I have many connections in the travel industry, and I will be exposing the company

[OPODO]
I extremely apologize for the inconvenience caused.
I will escalate the case for you and our team will assist you with the best we can do.
Please the link as well.

I exponentially apologize for the inconvenience caused.

[THOM]

[OPODO]
I extremely apologize for the inconvenience caused, as a human I can understand.

[THOM]
I was filling out the form

[OPODO]
Thank you.
Thomas. To summarize, I have also escalated the case for you, and our team will reach out to you via call about the inconvenience.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

[THOM]

[OPODO]
I wish you a happy married life. And I extremely apologize for the inconvenience caused, as a human I can understand.
